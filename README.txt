edgerunner is a terminal based game I'm making. It's heavily inspired by BSD-rogue. The gameplay will 
be somewhat different. During each level, the player will teleport from garph node to graph node trying 
to escape an entity that can kill him. Each level contains a portal to the next level. 

The levels will be procedurally generated graphs. 

I'll use ncurses to manipulate the command line window.

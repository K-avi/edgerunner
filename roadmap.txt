version beta : ---------------------------

graph generation : 
->make sure the graph is connex every time (not a bug but a feature atm)
    -> implement dfs to make spanning tree then postfix run of spanning tree, this way I know the 
       leaves of the tree and I know I can safely delete links / nodes from them
        -> this works for nodes 
        -> for links do a thing where you save the links deleted by the bfs to keep 
            in track which one to keep or not 

main :
-> enable option to change parameters (modify globals w options)
-> from the game settings maybe idk

"graphics" :
-> create a menu in a window 

bugs : 
-> sometime the game will crash with a floating point exception I have 0 idea why. 
It's rare. I guess it has smtg to do with the graph generation section.
->sometimes you won't be able to move idk why

misc : 
->code documentation (kinda)
->code refactoring (merge some files)
    -> code refactoring is VERY IMPORTANT 
-> make the checks mean something ffs 

version beta / 1.0 : -----------------------

-> REPLACE FREEFUNCTIONS BY FLUSH FUNCTIONS !!!!! 

"graphics" :
-> colors (maybe 1.0 idk how it works in ncurses)

ennemy : 
->  sillier AI that isn't too dumb (ask fox)
game : 
-> save scores somewhere
-> add special nodes (teleport nodes)

misc : 
AI vs AI screensaver mode

"graphics" :
-> create a menu in a window 

game mechanics : 
->add an ennemy after a certain level 
    -> implement an ennemy tab 
        -> need to replace the ennemy by an ennemy tab in the game 
           atm I need to add the checks 
    -> ennemy deletion after he moved



graph generation : 
->make sure the graph is connex every time (not a bug but a feature atm)

bugs : 
-> sometime the game will crash with a floating point exception I have 0 idea why. 
It's rare. I guess it has smtg to do with the graph generation section.
->sometimes you won't be able to move idk why
->sometimes the ennemy does weird shit

misc : 
->code documentation 
->code refactoring (merge some files)
-> make the checks mean something ffs

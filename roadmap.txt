version 1.0 : -----------------------

new feature  : 
-> AI vs AI and / screensaver mode

    -> do something more "fair" by exploring nodes that "get you close" 
       to the exit according to darp. When exploring make sure to close path you've seen 
       and so on 
            -> maintain an "explored" set and a "not explored" set 
                -> explored contains node you've seen and  visited 
                -> not explored contains the ones you've seen and not visited 
                -> you go to the node in "not explored" that is the closest (in coordinates) 
                   to the exit coordinates 
                

            -> then I'll have to figure a way to implement avoiding ennemies 

    -> then do smtg similar to the ennemy fn structure and have 
       multiple functions 

    -> find a way to take ennemy into account 

psinfo is fucking stupid. Every relevant information is already on the fucking graph ffs.
Redo the structure from scratch taking that into account. 


new feature : 
-> save scores / leaderboard

gameplay improvements : 

-> add special nodes (teleport nodes)
-> add a key to open the door after a certain level 
-> add an hp  / extra life / shield
-> add a "map" item
-> have AIs spawn at certain levels, get a bonus if you finish the level 
   before them 
-> improve the score system

ennemy improvements: 
->  sillier AI that isn't too dumb (ask fox)
-> print ennemy when on the same node than exit 
-> I think the stay function is bugged

code improvements : 
    
    -> a lot of things memory allocation related things 
       could be done more efficiently 

        -> a good way to do all of that would be to use an Arena with a 
           custom allocator

            -> don't free graphs between levels ; just flush it 
            -> keep as much arrays as possible 
        -> however that would be a lot of efforts and idk how 
           usefull that'll be 

        -> I kinda want to implement an Arena for fun though so I might end up doing it 
           but it's not a priority

version 1.0 : -----------------------

new feature  : 
-> AI vs AI and / or screensaver mode
    -> first implement a choice function based on shortest path
       for test purpose 

    -> then do something more "fair" by exploring nodes that "get you close" 
       to the exit according to darp. When exploring make sure to close path you've seen 
       and so on 
            -> maintain an "explored" set and a "not explored" set 
                -> explored contains node you've seen and  visited 
                -> not explored contains the ones you've seen and not visited 
                -> you go to the node in "not explored" that is the closest (in coordinates) 
                   to the exit coordinates 
                

            -> then I'll have to figure a way to implement avoiding ennemies 

    -> then do smtg similar to the ennemy fn structure and have 
       multiple functions 

    -> find a way to take ennemy into account 


new feature : 
-> save scores / leaderboard

gameplay improvements : 
-> add special nodes (teleport nodes)
-> add a key to open the door after a certain level 
-> add an hp item 
-> add a "map" item

ennemy improvements: 
->  sillier AI that isn't too dumb (ask fox)
-> print ennemy when on the same node than exit 

new feature : (might not implement it )
2 player mode

code improvements : 
    
    -> a lot of things memory allocation related things 
       could be done more efficiently 

        -> a good way to do all of that would be to use an Arena with a 
           custom allocator

            -> don't free graphs between levels ; just flush it 
            -> keep as much arrays as possible 
        -> however that would be a lot of efforts and idk how 
           usefull that'll be 

        -> I kinda want to implement an Arena for fun though so I might end up doing it 
           but it's not a priority
